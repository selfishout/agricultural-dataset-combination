# 🌾 Sample Image Segmentation Project

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a sample project that demonstrates how to use the **Combined Agricultural Dataset** for Image Segmentation tasks. The project implements a simple U-Net architecture and training pipeline to showcase the practical application of our combined dataset.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the sample training
python train_segmentation.py

# Evaluate the model
python evaluate_model.py

# Visualize results
python visualize_results.py
```

## 🎨 Model Architecture

- **U-Net**: Classic encoder-decoder architecture for image segmentation
- **Input**: 512x512 RGB images from combined dataset
- **Output**: 512x512 segmentation masks
- **Loss**: Dice Loss + Binary Cross Entropy
- **Optimizer**: Adam with learning rate scheduling

## 📊 Dataset Usage

The project uses our combined agricultural dataset:
- **Training**: 43,934 images (70%)
- **Validation**: 12,552 images (20%)
- **Testing**: 6,277 images (10%)

## 🔧 Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize:
- Training parameters
- Model architecture
- Data augmentation
- Paths and directories

## 📈 Expected Results

- **Training Loss**: Should decrease over epochs
- **Validation Dice Score**: Should improve over time
- **Sample Predictions**: Visual segmentation results
- **Performance Metrics**: IoU, Dice coefficient, accuracy

## 🎉 What You'll Learn

1. How to load and preprocess the combined dataset
2. How to implement a basic segmentation model
3. How to train and evaluate segmentation models
4. How to visualize and interpret results
5. Practical application of agricultural computer vision

## 🚨 Note

This is a **sample/demo project** designed to showcase the dataset. For production use, you may want to:
- Use more sophisticated architectures (DeepLab, SegNet, etc.)
- Implement advanced data augmentation
- Add more evaluation metrics
- Use transfer learning from pre-trained models
- Implement cross-validation
